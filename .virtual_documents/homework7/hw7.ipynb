# The section NumPy Array Indexing helped me write my function. There was an example in which an element in the first row, second column was accessed so I copied that structure.

# Your comments here

# All the numbers have clear descriptions of what they represent. Overall functions are also well described and the functions are organized and structured. I'm not quite sure where room for improvement lies but variables like sum and result if over used or used too interchangeably could end up becoming confusing.





# Your comment here

# I am interested in chemistry as well as physics so I wanted to make a module that would display the results of a chemical reaction.
# Water is one of the most basic molecules in chemistry as it is used in dilution, solution creation, combustion reactions, and more.
# Chemistry I'd say is most known for chemical reactions so I wanted to describe and simulate a module that would tell me about the limiting reactant of an equation involving water as limiting reactants determine how much product is created in a reaction.





# Your comment here

# Chemistry was a LOT harder to build a module for than I expected. On top of the basic stoichiometry and calculations for determining the limiting reactant, I also had to write small notes at each step to describe processes and there were a lot of small niche codes that I had to include that I didn't know existed.
# I unfortunately had to rely heavily on ChatGPT and online examples to help me write this module.
# It was nice in the to actual have a structured module that let me see my functions and steps from an organized perspective
# Next time I would work with an easier topic and learn a lot more about numpy before taking on this task. I did learn lot about numpy from the tutorial website but I feel like it wasn't enough to make me prepared for this task.
